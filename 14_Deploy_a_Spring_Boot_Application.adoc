Deploy a SpringBoot Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will deploy a SpringBoot application using a custom
source to image builder image.

*Step 1:* Using the knowledge you gained from the earlier labs create a
new project with name `spring-UserName`. *Remember* to substitute the
`UserName` with your userid.

*Step 2:* Create a new application using SpringBoot S2I Builder image.
Here we will deploy sample code from a git repository
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app. Please take time
to understand the code; it is pretty simple.

You may want to clone this into your git repository and deploy that, if
you want to make changes and test.

*Note:* We are using an S2I builder image from docker directly. This S2I
builder image was created using this Dockerfile.

$ oc new-app veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app --name=bootapp --build-env="MVN_ARGS=-Dhttp.proxyHost=10.115.90.145 -Dhttp.proxyPort=8888 -Dhttps.proxyHost=10.115.90.145 -Dhttps.proxyPort=8888"
--> Found Docker image c3ddd9e (7 days old) from Docker Hub for "veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base"

    Spring Boot Maven 3
    -------------------
    Platform for building and running Spring Boot applications

    Tags: builder, java, java8, maven, maven3, springboot

    * An image stream will be created as "spring-mvn-base:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "bootapp:latest"
      * Every time "spring-mvn-base:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "bootapp"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "bootapp"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "bootapp"

--> Creating resources with label app=bootapp ...
    imagestream "spring-mvn-base" created
    imagestream "bootapp" created
    buildconfig "bootapp" created
    deploymentconfig "bootapp" created
    service "bootapp" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/bootapp' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

Note that Red Hat has recently released a JDK S2I image. An alternative and more supported way to create the application would be as per the new-app below, however to maintain compatibility with subsequent labs we use the method provided.
```
oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app --name=bootapp --build-env=MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=<<PROVIDED BY INSTRUCTOR>>
```

Expose Service to create a route

....
$ oc expose service bootapp
route "bootapp" exposed
....

Check the route

....
$ oc get route
NAME      HOST/PORT                                      PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
bootapp   bootapp-spring-UserName.apps.devday.ocpcloud.com             bootapp    8080-tcp   
....

Wait for your application to be built and deployed. Using the knowlege
you gained from the previous labs, check your build logs by running
`oc logs -f <build pod name>`

*Step 3*

Test your application by using the hostname assigned in the route.

Congratulations!! You are now running a SpringBoot application on
OpenShift.
